IMD wanted an answer to stage large volume of satellite data staging in multi-tiered storage as per customers configurable SLA (if the capacity > 70% move to next tier). Also, the respective application server should find the data automatically in case they get staged to a net tier. Not to mention that need a specific solution which is lightweight, simple and open.
