IMD leveraged our strategic solutions to fast\r\n              forward their current scenario into a better vision that became a\r\n              reality by embracing our services. IMD wanted an answer to stage\r\n              large volume of satellite data staging in multi-tiered storage as\r\n              per customers configurable SLA (if the capacity > 70% move to next\r\n              tier). Also, the respective application server should find the\r\n              data automatically in case they get staged to a net tier. Not to\r\n              mention that need a specific solution which is lightweight, simple\r\n              and open. <br />\r\n              After digesting the requirements, what our technical connoisseurs\r\n              did was something incredible. We used Alfresco Content Management\r\n              solution to store all the files. The management solution puts the\r\n              business flow in a fast track mode and integrates very\r\n              intelligently. We mapped the different tiers of storage to a\r\n              different folder and penned an automation script to check the\r\n              capacity of primary storage to secondary periodically. Then we\r\n              integrated the original data processing application with Alfresco\r\n              API, to store and access data.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h2>OUTCOME</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"lineHeight-24\">\r\n              The resulted solution helped IMD to save cost on primary storage\r\n              by 50%. They also reduced 90% operations job of moving data in\r\n              different storage tiers. We helped them stage huge data without\r\n              changing any of their existing application. The entire\r\n              infrastructure is maintained with the code that we created and\r\n              tailored as per their business requests.
