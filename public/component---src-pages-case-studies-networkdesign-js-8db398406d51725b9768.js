The Medfusion’s development and deployment team communicate via an email to the data center admin with an attached form that specifies resource details. Then the admin takes an approval from the manager by email and manually go to vSphere administration console and create the resources as per the requirements. The process includes creating the virtual machine from existing template, and then doing the custom configuration as requested by the user and finally allocating and fixing the IP’s in the resources to send an email to the customer on completing the necessary tasks.

The heavy downpour of requests and tackling it manually to take the requests from service desk consumed their time and resources. After all the assessment and planning we did come up with a solution that caters not only the creations of virtual machines but also to bootstrap their current security configurations. We implemented a complete business process in Jira in conjunction with some automation task in Jenkins. It goes this way, when the Dev team sends an email or a service request, the service desk tickets gets automatically created and the admin would approve the request. Next, the Jenkin job engine triggers a provisioning job and the job engine will notify Jira about the completion of the task along with the resource information.

We conducted multiple PoC’S with Large Motor Company to channel a solid understanding of the technologies and modernize their IT infrastructure. By translating the entire hardware infrastructure into a few lines of software code, we crafted a backbone infrastructure effortlessly.
